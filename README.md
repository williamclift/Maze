# Maze

This application takes user input to determine the size of the matrix representing a maze and uses a randomized algorithm to create a solvable path through the matrix. Then, in a separate operation, the MazeSolver branches through the tunnels of the maze, searching for the end of the tunnel. It then outputs the path marked with 'x' in the most efficient way and outputs the each step.
